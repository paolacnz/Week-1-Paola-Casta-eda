- Calculate the volume of a pyramid

1. Measure the length and width of the base of the pyramid. Let's call the length "L" and the width "W".

2. Multiply the length and width together to find the area of the base. This is the bottom of the pyramid, and the formula is A = L x W.

3. Measure the height of the pyramid. Let's call this "H".

4. Divide the height by 3. This gives you the height of one of the four triangular faces of the pyramid. Let's call this "h".

5. Calculate the volume of the pyramid using the formula V = (A x h) / 3. In other words, multiply the area of the base by the height of one of the triangular faces, and then divide by 3

<the formula for the volume of a pyramid is:>

V = (L x W x H) / 3.

<Or, if you know the area of the base (A) and the height of one of the triangular faces (h), you can use this formula:>

V = (A x h) / 3.
  
- volume of a cube
  
1. Measure the length of one side of the cube. Let's call this "s".

2. Multiply the length of one side by itself twice. This is the same as raising it to the third power. In other words, V = s x s x s, or V = s^3.

3. The resulting number is the volume of the cube
  So, the formula for the volume of a cube is:

V = s^3
  
- Volume of a sphere
  
1. Measure the radius of the sphere. Let's call this "r".

2. Cube the radius by multiplying it by itself twice. In other words, r^3.

3. Multiply the result from step 2 by 4/3.

4. Multiply the result from step 3 by pi (π). The value of pi is approximately 3.14.

So, the formula for the volume of a sphere is:

V = (4/3) x π x r^3.
